### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm part of the team at [Coder One](https://www.gocoder.one), an open simulation playground where anyone can get hands-on experience with machine learning on real-world challenges.

We're currently running a competition called [Bomberland](https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland), inspired by Bomberman. Teams train intelligent agents using strategies from tree search to deep reinforcement learning, and compete against other participants across the globe to win prizes and get featured on our [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/CoderOneHQ).
