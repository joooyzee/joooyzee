I'm building [Coder One](https://www.gocoder.one), an open simulation playground where anyone can get hands-on experience with machine learning on real-world challenges.

We're currently running an AI competition called [Bomberland](https://www.gocoder.one/bomberland), inspired by the classic console game Bomberman. Train intelligent agents and compete against other participants across the globe to win prizes and get featured on our [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/CoderOneHQ).
